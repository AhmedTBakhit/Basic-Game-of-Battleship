 Battleship is a two player Navy game. The objective of the game is to sink all ships in your enemy's fleet. The player to sink his/her enemy's fleet first wins. Both players' fleets consist of 5 ships that are hidden from the enemy. Each ship may be differentiated by its "size" (besides the Cruiser and Submarine) or number of cells it expands on the game board. The Carrier has 5 cells, Battleship has 4 cells, Cruiser has 3 cells, Submarine has 3 cells, and the Destroyer has 2 cells.
